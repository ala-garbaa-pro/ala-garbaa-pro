My name is Ala and I’m Full Stack Developer. <br />

First of all, I don’t think that I know everything, but I always focus on learning and practicing.<br />
I am familiar with Development, OS, Security, Servers, Design & Personal Development; I focus on trending technologies to prepare for the new technology; then, I create Projects, Posts, Documentation, and Answer problem-solving questions about them to level up our skills.<br />
